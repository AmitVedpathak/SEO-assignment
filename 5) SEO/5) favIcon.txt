A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small graphical representation or icon associated with a website or web page. 
It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes in the history or search results. 
Favicons serve as a visual branding element for a website, making it easier for users to identify and recognize the site when they have multiple tabs open or when they bookmark it.

Favicons are usually square in shape and are commonly sized at 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels, 
though higher-resolution versions are also used for better display on high-density screens. 
They are typically saved in the .ico file format, but other image formats like .png can also be used.

Illustrative example:
Let's say you visit the website "www.example.com." In your browser's address bar, you may see a tiny icon displayed next to the website's URL, 
which is the favicon. If "www.example.com" had a star-shaped favicon, it might look something like this:

[Star-shaped favicon]

This star-shaped icon is the favicon for "www.example.com," and it helps you quickly identify the website among your open tabs or bookmarks. 
Different websites have their own unique favicons, which contribute to the visual identity and branding of the site.
